# TensorFlow Probability Playground

## Summary

This repository is here to serve the sole purpose of having an active playground where I can learn and become more familiar with TensorFlow Probability. I am exploring TensorFlow Probability as a promising tool to replace PyMC3 for my probabilistic programming needs.

**It is very unlikely that anything in this repository will be of any use to users other than myself.**

Most code will likely either not be documented, or will be poorly documented with minimal notes used as prompts for me to remember certain things. Therefore, expect the Jupyter notebooks contained here to simply function as messy sketchpads for my own use.
